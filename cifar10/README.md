# Cifar10

Before you train your own model, you need to prepare dataset first. 

If you want to use cifar10 and use my code to make your dataset, you need donwload 'cifar-10-python.tar.gz', and 'tar -zxvf cifar-10-python.tar.gz'. 

Then use 'cifar10_train.py' and 'cifar10_test.py' to make 50k train pictures and 10k test pictures. 

Last you can use 'package_train.py' and 'package_test.py'(in fact I use it as validation set) to make your train set and test set.
